        <h1>Typography in Bootstrap is designed to provide consistency, readability, and flexibility across different devices and screen sizes.<small class="text-mute">Bootstrap uses a responsive typography system that automatically adjusts font sizes based on the viewport size, ensuring text is readable on all devices.</small> It relies on the default font stack of system fonts, which includes styles like sans-serif. By default, Bootstrap sets the base font size to 16px and the line-height to 1.5, making text appear balanced and easily readable.</h1>
